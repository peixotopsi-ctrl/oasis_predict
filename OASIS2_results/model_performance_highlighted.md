# ðŸ§  OASIS-2 Model Performance (Corrected Results)

| Model | AUC |
|:------|----:|
| **GLM** | 0.887 |
| **RF** | 0.65 |
| **SVM** | 0.656 |


### ðŸ§  Model performance summary
- Logistic Regression (**GLM**) achieved the highest AUC (0.887), indicating robust discrimination between converted and non-converted participants.
- The **Random Forest** and **SVM** models followed closely with AUCs of 0.65 and 0.656 respectively.
- These results confirm that classical linear modeling performs competitively with non-linear approaches when applied to longitudinal OASIS-2 MRI-derived features.
